### Hello World

After several years of working as an automation specialist, I started in IT, and here I found a
job that fascinates me. Finally! Now becoming a highly skilled programmer is only a matter of
time.
Currently, after hours, I am developing my C# programming skills for web applications and in
the near future, I would like to find time to learn more about security.
